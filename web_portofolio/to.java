This project focuses on the creation of an innovative tool borrowing solution utilizing an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) equipped with advanced features. The AGV functions as a line-tracking robot, capable of autonomously navigating along predefined paths for tool borrowing purposes. It incorporates RFID tagging technology for user and tool identification, streamlining the borrowing process and enhancing accountability. Additionally, the AGV is equipped with automatic obstacle avoidance capabilities to ensure safe and efficient navigation in dynamic environments. Furthermore, the project includes live IoT camera monitoring, allowing users to remotely monitor the AGV's movements and activities in real-time. Tool borrowing management is facilitated through a PHP-based website, providing users with a user-friendly interface to request and track tool borrowings. By integrating RFID, IoT, and line-tracking technologies, this project offers a comprehensive solution for automated tool borrowing management, improving efficiency and productivity in industrial settings.
