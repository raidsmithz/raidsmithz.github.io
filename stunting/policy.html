               </div>
               <p>Devsmith built the Stunting Checker app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Devsmith at no cost
                  and is intended for use as is.

                  to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the

                  Policy.

                  The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are

                  </li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Log Data</h2>
               <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data
                  and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                  include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating
                  system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use
                  of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

               <h2>Cookies</h2>

                  These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
                  internal memory.

                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
                  libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
                  either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

               <h2>Service Providers</h2>
               <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

               <ul class="tickbox">

                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are
                  obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
